                        you cannot be identified. In the second case, an unregistered user will be prompted

                        they be able to view your detailed profile. Whereas in the third case nobody will

                        The photograph privacy settings options are available in the 'My Photos' section
                        of the 'My Profile' page. This page can be accessed after you have registered your
